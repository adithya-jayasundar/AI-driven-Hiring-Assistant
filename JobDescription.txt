Role: Machine Learning Engineer
Location: Remote / Hybrid
Experience Required: 1–3 years (or strong academic + project portfolio)

About the Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in deep learning, NLP, and building end-to-end AI solutions. The ideal candidate has experience working on computer vision or document intelligence systems, building semantic search pipelines, and training or fine-tuning deep learning models.

You will work across the entire ML lifecycle—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model development, evaluation, deployment, and retrieval-based search optimization.

Responsibilities

Develop, fine-tune, and evaluate deep learning models for document understanding, NLP, or computer vision tasks.

Work with transformer-based architectures such as LayoutLM, BERT, or custom CNN/RNN/Generative models.

Build semantic search systems using Elasticsearch, FAISS, or other vector databases.

Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines for intelligent document processing.

Design and optimize data pipelines for structured and unstructured data (text, images, PDFs).

Build and deploy end-to-end ML applications using Python and modern frameworks.

Work closely with cross-functional teams to improve model performance, reliability, and scalability.

Must-Have Skills

Strong Python programming experience

Experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch or TensorFlow)

Hands-on experience with one or more:

LayoutLM or other transformer/NLP models

CNN/LSTM architectures

GANs (CycleGAN or similar)

Knowledge of semantic search (Elasticsearch, FAISS, or vector databases)

Strong understanding of machine learning concepts: preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation

Experience working with unstructured text or documents

SQL and basic backend experience (FastAPI, Flask, etc.)

Important Skills (Good to Have)

MLOps practices (model versioning, reproducible pipelines)

Experience with RAG pipelines

Knowledge of cloud platforms (Google Cloud, AWS, or similar)

Experience with OCR-based processing (Tesseract, RegEx)

Frontend or UI experience using Streamlit, React, or similar

Nice-to-Have Skills

Experience with multilingual models

Experience with BigQuery / Dataproc or similar cloud data tools

Knowledge of vector embeddings and LLM-based search optimization

Soft Skills

Strong communication and documentation skills

Problem-solving and analytical thinking

Ability to work independently and with cross-functional teams

Curiosity to learn emerging ML/AI techniques

Minimum Experience

1–3 years of relevant experience
OR

Strong academic/project portfolio demonstrating deep learning, model training, AI application development, and semantic search.
